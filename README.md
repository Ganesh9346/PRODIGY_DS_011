Data Science Internship – Task 1
Company: Prodigy Infotech
Domain: Data Science
Task: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Health Dataset

📌 Overview
As part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I completed Task 1, which focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a health-related dataset. This task involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

🧠 Objectives
Understand the structure and key attributes of the health dataset.

Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy.

Explore relationships between variables like age, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, and cholesterol levels.

Generate visual insights using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

📊 What I Did
✅ Loaded the dataset and explored its structure.

✅ Cleaned missing values using SimpleImputer.

✅ Removed special characters using regex for categorical columns like production_countries and genres.

✅ Calculated average scores across health indicators.

✅ Visualized distributions and trends using bar plots, heatmaps, and box plots.

✅ Analyzed correlation between features using a correlation matrix.

✅ Derived insights on how lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol, and physical activity affect health.
